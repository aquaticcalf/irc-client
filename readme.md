## Java IRC Client
A Java-based IRC client for connecting to Internet Relay Chat servers.

### What is IRC?
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a protocol for real-time communication over the internet. It allows users to connect to servers and join channels, where they can engage in text-based conversations with others. IRC has been around since the late 1980s and remains a popular platform for online communities and discussions.

### Project Overview

### Goals
- Build a reliable and feature-rich IRC client that's a joy to use
- Support multiple servers and networks, so users can connect to their favorite communities
- Design an intuitive interface that makes it easy to navigate and chat with others

### Status
This project is currently in the planning and development stage. Not much code has been written yet, but I'm excited to get started!
